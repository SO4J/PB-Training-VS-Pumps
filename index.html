                <h1 class="display-3" style="text-align: center;">What is a variable speed pool pump?</h1>
                <p class="lead" style="text-align: justify;">A variable speed pool pump takes the awesome use of a pool pump motor and makes it up to 90% more energy effecient, while at the same time giving the pool owner complete control over their pool system's water flow. These pumps are dramatically more quiet than traditional single speed pump motors. Variable speed pumps also have advanced programming options. These pumps come in traditional almond or black colors. You can find a variable speed pool pump from all of the top maufacturers, including Pentair, Jandy (who is now officially Fludria), Hayward, Waterway, and even Jaccuzzi. We will not be looking at the last two, but it's good to know for random trivia purposes, I suppose.</p>
                <hr class="my-4">
                <p style="text-align: center;">Now that we know what a variable speed pool pump is, let's dive into the science behind it, as well as benefits and a quick look at the most popular models.</p>

                    <h1 class="display-4" style="text-align: center;">Here are some great features to know and keep in mind when selling a variable speed pool pump to a customer.</h1>
                </div>
                <div class="card text-white bg-info mb-3" style="max-width: 20rem;">

                        <div class="card-body" id="text1">
                            <p class="card-text">Some variable speed pumps come with a keypad directly on the pump. This can be very useful when a customer doesn't have automation.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                <div class="card border-info mb-3" style="max-width: 20rem;">

                        <div class="card-body">
                            <p class="card-text" id="text2">For the models that don't have a keypad directly on-board, these models will often come with a wired heypad that can be mounted on the wall.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                <div class="card text-white bg-primary mb-3" style="max-width: 20rem;">

                        <div class="card-body">
                            <p class="card-text" id="text3">For the customer that does have an automation panel, these pumps can communicate with the controller for full automation and control. There are some limitations with Hayward controllers and non-Hayward variable speed pool pumps, just be aware.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                        <div class="card-body">
                            <p class="card-text" id="text4">A big selling point that is often overlooked, is the fact that these variable speed pool pumps come with a TEFC motor, which is an abbreviation for Totally Enclosed Fan Cooled motor. This keeps the motor cooler than the traditional ODP motor, or Open Drip_Proof motor, which pulls air into the slots while running. The TEFC design also allows for the pump to be installed nearly against a wall without having heating issues.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                <div class="card text-white bg-secondary mb-3" style="max-width: 20rem;">

                        <div class="card-body">
                            <p class="card-text" id="text5">Nearly every variable speed pool pump has options to set numerous speeds and schedules. This allows dominating control over flow, features, and run time. The number of programmable speeds will vary by brand and model. This means that normal pool filtration can be set to an energy saving speed, but when the customer wants their water feature to be nice and prominent, the variable speed pool pump can ramp up and achieve what the customer is desiring.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                        <div class="card-body">
                            <p class="card-text" id="text6">When it comes to variable speed pool pumps, it's not one size fits all. There are multiple options to choose from when it comes to overall horsepower. This is an important aspect to consider when selling to a customer. If they have inch and a half plumbing on a 15,000 gallon pool and no water features, it wouldn't be advisable to sell a 3 HP variable speed when there are lower horsepower optons that would be more appropriate.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                        <div class="card-body">
                            <p class="card-text" id="text7">As you may or may not know, effective July 19, 2021,;new U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) regulations will go into effect that require Dedicated Purpose Pool Pumps (DP3) manufactured in or imported into the U.S. meet minimum energy-efficiency standards. The standards apply to all pool pumps with a Hydraulic Horsepower (HHP) rating ≤ 2.5 HHP, with some limited exceptions. HHP is approximately 50% of the pump motor's total horsepower (THP) rating. Most pool pumps with a motor rating of 5.0 THP or less will be required to meet the minimum energy-efficiency standards.</p>

                        <div class="card-body">
                            <p class="card-text" id="text8">There is no distinction in the regulations between variable-speed and non-variable speed pumps. The regulations simply require dedicated purpose pool pumps to meet minimum energy-efficiency standards. The good news for variable speed pool pumps is that the regulations are written in a way that makes it relatively easy for most variable-speed pumps to meet the requirements. The regulations do however make it difficult for most non-variable-speed pumps ≥ 1.0 THP to meet the requirements. Many single-speed and two-speed pumps < 1.0 THP, including booster pumps, will meet the requirements. This makes a great selling point.</p>

                            <p class="card-text" id="text9">With the combination of the TEFC and the pump motor not running wide open constantly, the life span of a variable speed motor is incredible. This also includes the lifespan of the internal parts, like orings and seals.</p>

                            <p class="card-text" id="text10">Not all, but most of the variable speed pool pumps out there today have extra built in protection. These can include sensors that can detect if there is not enough water in the pump pot. They can also detect if the pump is pulling in too much air and not enough water, like a major air leak or maybe something getting caught in the pipe. This could also detect a low water issue. This is extremely beneficial because a pump without these features will continue to run and start heating up internally and it doesn't take long to begin damaging both internal parts as well as external plumbing and fittings.</p>

                            <p class="card-text" id="text11">Something that isn't always plainly advertised to us as technicians is the fact that most of the year, there are rebates that incentivize customers to make the leap to a new variable speed pool pump. This is especially true for Pentair.</p>

                            <p class="card-text" id="text12">The last benefit to share here, is the fact that with a variable speed pool pump, you can set the pump to run 24 hours a day and still save on energy costs. This will ensure that the pool water is always being filtered and cleaned. Knowing the facts about how the variable speed pump works and how it saves money is often vital to be able to explain to the customer why is beneficial to run their pump 24 hours a day.</p>

                    <h1 class="display-5" style="text-align: center;">Let's look at some cool facts and some applications of operation of the variable speed pool pumps!</h1>
                    <p class="lead">You should be aware of the science behind variable speed pool pumps, so you will not only be able to answer the customer's questions they ask you "how is this any better", and you'll have the confidence to answer right away.</p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <div class="card col-lg-6 offset-lg-3 col-md-10 offset-md-1 col-sm-12">
                    <div class="card-body">
                        <h5 class="card-title" id="pumpAffinityTitle" style="text-align: center; font-size: 42px;">Pump Affinity Law</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">This is the "brainiest" piece of information you can store in your head. Honestly, a lot of the time the customer won't have many more questions after "how does this save me money" or "how is this any better" if you can spit this out confidently. Most of the time, it's well over the customer's head what you are saying, and you sound super smart and trustworthy. Below is a chart showing a nice example of speed (RPM) and flow (GPM) with the approximate power consumption.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">The law states that if you reduce the speed (RPM) of the pool pump by half (1/2), you only lose a quarter (1/4) of your flow, and you are only spending a eigth (1/8) of the electricity you were spending at full speed (3,450 RPMs).</p>
                        <p class="card-text">With this figure, you can easily see how running a pool pump 24 hours a day can still cost far less than a traditional single speed pump running 10 to 12 hours a day.</p>
                    </div>

                <div class="card col-lg-6 offset-lg-3 col-md-10 offset-md-1 col-sm-12">
                    <div class="card-body">
                        <h5 class="card-title" id="motorTechnologyTitle" style="text-align: center; font-size: 42px;">Motor Technology</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">As you can see in the picture below, the motor technology is different that traditional single speed pool pump motors. This makes a diffrence on both performance and longevity.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">The permanent magnet motor is a better design than the induction motor. Induction motors rely on electric current to turn the rotor. The electric current is generated through the electromagnetic  induction from the magnetic field of the stator windings. The permanent magnet motor relies on magnets to turn the rotor, and these spin at the same speed as the permenent magnet internal rotating magnetic field. The permenent magnet motor does require a drive to run, and the variable speed has a drive that is controlling the speed at which the magnets turn.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">It has been proven that permanent magnet motors are much more effecient than induction motors. You may never use this information, but it is cool to know.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">In the picture, you will see a diagram of the totally enclosed fan cooled motor (TEFC) that we talked about earlier.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h5 class="card-title" id="pumpPayingBackTitle" style="text-align: center; font-size: 42px;">Pump Paying You Back</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">Another fantastic selling point, is the fact that a variable speed pool pump will save the customer so much money in energy savings, that it is not unrealistic for the pump to pay for itself in the first two years of ownership. The picture below shows an example based on an average, so it will vary by market and usage, but all in all it still will apply to over 99% of the customers we sell to.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Imagine if you could save the customer between $50.00 and $100.00 a month on their electric bill? And if the customer is already running their single speed pump for 24 hours a day, forget about it! You could save them nearly $200.00 a month with their electric bill.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">If you want to know how much it costs to run the variable speed pool pump, then you need to know the electricity rates that the customer pays. Somewhere on their electricity bill, it will show a "per kWh charge". This should be how many cents they pay for each kWh (kilowatt hour) of electricity used. The variable speed pool pump will typically show the watts being consumed, and once you have all of the info, you can crunch the numbers. Below is an example.<p>
                        <p class="card-text">3450 RPM
                            <ul>
                                <li>Flow Rate = 82 GPM</li>
                                <li>Power Consumption = 2240 Watts</li>
                                <li>Cost per hour (based on 13 cents per kWh) = $0.29</li>
                                <li>Flow per hour = 4920 Gallons</li>
                                <li>Cost per 24 hours = $6.96</li>
                                <li>Flow per 24 hours = 118,080 Gallons</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">1730 RPM
